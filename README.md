This web dashboard is for Friends Series from [Friends Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bcruise/friends-episode-data) and it was created using [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/) with some data cleansing and data manipulation. Some insight from this dashboard:

1. The average IMDB rating is 8.42 with the highest rating is "The Last One" episode in season 10

2. Total viewers reach 5.9 Billion with the highest viewers is "The One After the Superbowl: Part 1" episode in season 2

3. All seasons have average IMDB rating at least 8,2

This is a simple web dashboard and it will be more interesting if putted some visualization like biggest character roles by screen time, or stories by places. But, I hope this web dashboard interactive enough to explain the informations. For further informations, please check in [here](https://datastudio.google.com/s/lIe10TW9CgI).
